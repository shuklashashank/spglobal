name: disabled-deploy-pages

# This workflow was deprecated and intentionally disabled because it used the
# Pages REST API which triggered "Not Found" errors in some repos. The active
# deployment workflow is `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` which publishes
# `./dist` to the `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`.
